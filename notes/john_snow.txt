John Snow (1813â€“1858) was a British physician, made significant contributions to the understanding of causation, 
particularly in the context of disease outbreaks

Made implications for evaluating causal discovery without the presence of ground truth information.


Cholera outbreak in London's Soho district: 

    - At the time, the prevailing belief was that diseases like cholera were spread through "miasma" (bad air). 
    
    - Snow suspected the cause was contaminated water.
    
    - He mapped the cases of cholera and the locations of water pumps in the area, discovering a 
    cluster of cases around a specific contaminated water pump on Broad Street.

    - By gathering and analyzing data on the locations of cases and water sources, Snow was able to demonstrate a 
    strong correlation between the contaminated water source and the disease outbreak. 
    
    - Used Spatial analysis of data to establish a causal relationship between a contaminated water and cholera.
